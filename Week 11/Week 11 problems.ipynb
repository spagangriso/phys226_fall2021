    "Because the electromagnetic interaction conserves parity, the angular distribution cannot contain any terms that are odd under parity inversion.  Weak interactions, however, do not conserve parity.  Since the $Z$ boson has the same quantum numbers as the photon, diagrams involving the $Z$ and the photon both contribute to the $e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-$ cross section.  The interference between these two diagrams introduces a term that violates parity.  Plot the angular distribution for the $\\mu^+$ and for the $\\mu^-$.  Is there evidence of parity violation in these plots?"
