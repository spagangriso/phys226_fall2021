    "Silicon microstrip and pixel detectors play a prominent role in many particle physics experiments. Their good spatial resolution, ability to distinguish nearby particles and radiation hardness make them attractive options. You have studied the position resolution of such detectors in a previous homework. Today, we will learn about how they are used to reconstruct particle trajectories and to identify the decay products of weakly decaying particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Track reconstruction can be roughly divided in two main steps. First, a pattern recognition algorithm is used to associate a set of measurements with a single trajectory. Then, these measurements are fit to determine track parameters according to a model of the trajectory. This problem focuses on this last step, where track parameters are determined and for simplicity will only involve a single charged particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll consider a detector composed of 5 planes (_layers_) of slicon pixel detectors (see e.g. [LHCb VELO detector](http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/en/detector/VELO-en.html) or [LDMX](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/MME/Light+Dark+Matter+Experiment?preview=/210534721/228306759/LDMX_summary.pdf) detector). For simplicity we'll treat the problem as 2D problem. The silicon detectors will measure one coordinate (r) and the other one (z) is given by their known initial position (assumed to be corresponding to the center of the silicon sensor). The nominal origin of particles sits at $(r,z)=(0,0)$; each layer is parallel to the $r$ axis; the first layer sits at a distance $r=D=5$ cm from the nominal origin and each subsequent layer is placed at a distance $L=3$ cm from the previous one. A schematic view is shown below and further details are given in the questions below. No magnetic field is present (a magnetic field parallel to the $z$ or $r$ direction won't change significantly the problems below, this is the case for e.g. the detectors mentioned above)."
