Instead, the measured momentum of the (only) visible decay product of the misterious particle can be used to statistically determine its mass. To achieve this, we need to know the expected distribution for the momentum of such a particle.\n",

This assumption is ok for strong and electromagnetic interactions. It also offers a \"fermi\" option (see the `SetDecay` method of the class) that allows to roughly model the momentum-dependence of the matrix element for weak interactions.
