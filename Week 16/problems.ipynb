    "Experiments at the LEP e^+e^- collider at CERN made precision measurements of the properties of the $Z$ boson.  Some of the earliest such measurements were determination of the $Z$ mass and width and using this data to constrain the number of light neutrino species that can couple to the $Z$.  This problem uses data compiled by the Particle Data Group to reproduce these measurements.  A detailed discussion of the processs $e^+e^-\\rightarrow Z\\rightarrow anything$ can be found in Chapter 16 of Thompson.  The concepts used in this problem are presented in Section 16.2 "

    "The $Z$ mass and width were measured at LEP by measuring the cross section as a function of center-of-mass energy for the processes $e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\mathrm{hadrons}$ and fitting the results to a Breit-Wigner function, which describes the observed shape of particles with parameters describing the mass and the width. Here hadrons indicates the sum of all the different decays of the $Z$ boson to different types of hadrons. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could solve the problem by fitting the cross-section directly. However, it turns out that it is easier instead to use a ratio of cross-sections. The precise variable that we'll use is called $R$, which is defined as the ratio of the measured rate for $e^+e^- \\rightarrow $hadrons to the predicted cross section for $e^+e^-\\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-$. It turns out that taking this ratio makes is easier to see some of the important physical effects of the $Z$ resonance.\n",
